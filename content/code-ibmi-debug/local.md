For your local client (VS Code) to connect to the server securely, we need to download the client certificate from the server.

We take the `/QIBM/ProdData/IBMiDebugService/bin/certs/debug_service.crt` file that was generated and download it to the home directory of the current user on the device that is running VS Code.
