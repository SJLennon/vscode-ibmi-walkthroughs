## Outline view

When you enable the VS Code outline, you see your code outlined. Run the 'Focus Outline' command to bring it into view. The Outline view can be moved to a more optimal position by dragging the title bar.

## Content assist

As you write new words, Visual Studio Code will prompt new suggestions based on defintions and include statements. If you want to see all possible suggestions you can use Control + Space to list them.

## Go to definiton

You can right click on any variable, subfield, etc, and use 'go to defintion' or 'peak definition' to move the cursor to where the reference is defined.

## References

You can right click on any variable, subfield, etc, and use 'show all references' or 'peak references' to show every reference to it.
