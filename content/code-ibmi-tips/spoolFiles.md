## Spool files

You can view the spool files from Actions that you run if you enable the 'Log Compile Output' setting.

## Viewing the spool output

Click the Output tab, which shows in the windows at the bottom of VS Code. If the Terminal panel is not open, you can open it with Control + J / Command + J.

The window has 4 tabs. Select the 'Terminal' tab.
